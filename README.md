## Introduction

Welcome to the **Neural Network Using Numpy** project! ðŸŽ‰ In this assignment, you'll dive into the fascinating world of neural networks by building one from scratch using just **Numpy**. Your goal is to create a network that can classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will:
- Implement the essential steps to build a neural network.
- Perform feedforward operations.
- Compute loss functions.
- Execute backpropagation for optimization.
- Update parameters (weights and biases).
- Train your model to classify handwritten digits.

## Sections Covered

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
2. **Feedforward**: Implement the forward pass of the network.
3. **Loss Computation**: Calculate the loss to measure the accuracy of the network.
4. **Backpropagation**: Compute gradients to optimize the network.
5. **Parameter Updates**: Adjust the weights and biases to improve model performance.
6. **Model Training and Predictions**: Train the neural network and make predictions on new data.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbhinavSharma07/Neural-Network-Using-NUMPY.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Neural-Network-using-Numpy
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Load the dataset:
   - You can refer to the `mnist.pkl.gz` file for the dataset.
   - The file will be automatically loaded in the Jupyter notebook.

5. Open the Jupyter Notebook to start coding:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Neural-Network-using-Numpy.ipynb
    ```

## Model Training and Predictions

The notebook is designed to guide you through the entire process of building and training a neural network. By the end of this project, you'll have a fully functional model capable of recognizing handwritten digits with high accuracy.

## Resources

- **MNIST Dataset**: The classic dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
